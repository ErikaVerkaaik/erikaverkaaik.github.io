At this point it’s been actual years since I have properly worked on anything creative and I finally feel like I have the energy to start again. I have been doing some other things here and there[^1] but from 2016-2018 I was just burnt out.

I don’t really know what changed, or if it was just a matter of time, but I’m ready to return to game development. Writing about and reflecting on my own work seems to be the way I learn the best (surprise surprise), so I’m starting up this blog.

The aim of this blog is to track, catalogue and reflect on my work, processes, research and learning. The primary goal is to motivate myself to take creative practice seriously again. Being able to actually look back and see the work that I have done should help with this and should encourage me to keep going. I often use things like Twitter as motivation but quickly stop working on projects once I have the validation I need from it. With that in mind, I don’t intend to promote or share this blog in any way but it will be kept public.

Lastly, I would like to say that the name “abandoned greenhouse”[^2] has some deep, introspective meaning: a space that was once a thriving has been abandoned by it’s creator only to find itself renewed blah blah blah… but I have actually just been saving a bunch of images of abandoned greenhouses to my phone because I think it would be a cool setting for something and haven’t decided on what.

Anyway, that’s enough rambling for now. Let’s get started.

[^1]: Like getting a lecturing job and running a couple of communities. I should probably give myself some credit for these but it’s not the same as actually making games…
[^2]: This blog was intially posted on a tumblr called "abandoned greenhouse" but I have since moved it over to my own site and closed the tumblr.
